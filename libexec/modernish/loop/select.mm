# An alias + internal function pair for a ksh/bash/zsh-style 'select' loop.
# This aims to be a perfect replica of the 'select' loop in these shells,
# making it truly cross-platform. The modernish reimplementation is only
# loaded in shells that don't have it built in.
#
# BUG: 'select' is not a true shell keyword, but an alias for two commands.
# This means two things:
# 1.	Even if 'in arg ...' is omitted so that the positional parameters
#	are used, the ';' before 'do' is still mandatory. So instead of
#		select NAME do COMMANDS; done
#	you have to say
#		select NAME; do COMMANDS; done
#	Thankfully this is also accepted by all the native implementations,
#	so the variant with the extra ';' is compatible with everything.
# 2.	You can't pipe data directly into a 'select' loop.
#	Workaround: enclose the entire loop in braces, like this:
#	somecommand | { select NAME in STUFF; do COMMANDS; done; }
# Also note:
# - If a user presses Ctrl-D (EOF), native 'select' in bash and *ksh
#   exits the loop with status 1; modernish exits with status 0 because
#   this is internally a 'while' loop. (zsh also exits with status 0.)
# - If a user presses Ctrl-D (EOF), native 'select' on zsh does not clear
#   the REPLY variable, so it will contain whatever it did before 'select'.
#   But modernish automatically clears it because it uses 'read'. All other
#   native implementations also clear it.
#
# Citing from 'help select' in bash 3.2.57:
#	select: select NAME [in WORDS ... ;] do COMMANDS; done
#	    The WORDS are expanded, generating a list of words.  The
#	    set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each
#	    preceded by a number.  If `in WORDS' is not present, `in "$@"'
#	    is assumed.  The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a line read
#	    from the standard input.  If the line consists of the number
#	    corresponding to one of the displayed words, then NAME is set
#	    to that word.  If the line is empty, WORDS and the prompt are
#	    redisplayed.  If EOF is read, the command completes.  Any other
#	    value read causes NAME to be set to null.  The line read is saved
#	    in the variable REPLY.  COMMANDS are executed after each selection
#	    until a break command is executed.
