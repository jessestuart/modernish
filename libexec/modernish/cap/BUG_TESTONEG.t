# BUG_TESTONEG: The test -o negative bug
# On yash (up to 2.43), the nonstandard -o operator for the test/[ builtin,
# which checks if a shell option is set, ignores no* in the option name,
# so something like [ -o noclobber ] gives a false positive.
# Ref.: https://osdn.jp/ticket/browse.php?group_id=3863&tid=36662

# If we don't have '[' built in, none of this applies. /bin/[ could never
# check for a shell option as it can't have access.
