# BUG_FNREDIRP: I/O redirections on function definitions are forgotten if the
# function is called as part of a pipeline with at least one '|'. (bash 2.05b)
#
# Workaround: use an extra pair of braces either when defining the
# function or when calling the function. For instance, either:
#	_Msh_testFn() { {
#		echo hi
#	} >/dev/null; }
# or:
#	case $(: | { _Msh_testFn; }) in
# would cause this bug to remain undetected on bash 2.05b.

_Msh_testFn() {
	PATH=$DEFPATH command echo bug
} >/dev/null
