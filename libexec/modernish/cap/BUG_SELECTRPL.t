# BUG_SELECTRPL: in a shell-native 'select' loop, input that is not a menu
# item is not stored in the REPLY variable as it should be.
#
# Unfortunately, circumventing the bug by replacing 'select' with
# modernish's 'select' implementation from var/loop/select.mm is impossible
# because 'select' is a reserved word and cannot be replaced.
#
# Bug found in mksh R50 2014/09/03.
# Known to be fixed as of mksh R50 2015/04/19.
